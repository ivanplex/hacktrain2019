The current situation deteriorated when Siemens piled a new OHL mast into the drainage system during PARR works and flooded the location, leading to a large dump of silt and residue through the tunnels. 

27-SEP-18 Continued:-S. Colvin is following this up with the projects department regarding the remedial works to recover the asset. As it stands just now the small levels of water collecting at the rail foot will fail the track circuit due to the silt present. Further update will be provided in due course with plan to resolve.

26-SEP-18 Pway re-advised and will update ICC with plans to mitigate against further failures.
26-SEP-18 WSSC reports track circuit 3470 has failed of own accord. Track circuit is located on the Down Slow line at Eglinton Street tunnel. Protecting signal is G5203. 
26-SEP-18 S&T staff advised.
27-SEP-18 1320 on 26/09/18:-Stuart Colvin, Track Maintenance Engineer (Glasgow Central), updates with the following: 
The water levels are not at a level where a pump would make any difference - plus there are no pumps on site. 

27-SEP-18 cont:-The issue stems from historic water ingress within the tunnel from a historical Scottish Water issue which has been partially rectified. The current situation deteriorated when Siemens piled a new OHL mast into the drainage system during PARR works and flooded the location, leading to a large dump of silt and residue through the tunnels. 

27-SEP-18 Continued:-S. Colvin is following this up with the projects department regarding the remedial works to recover the asset. As it stands just now the small levels of water collecting at the rail foot will fail the track circuit due to the silt present. Further update will be provided in due course with plan to resolve. 
27-SEP-18 0505:S&T attended and it is due to track conditions . TME is already aware and chasing up with projects. 
28-SEP-18 ICC Flight Engineer confirms TC3470 remains clear and has operated correctly throughout the day today.

SSM WSSC updated and requested to facilitate a 10"" line blockage after the passage of 2N15 [1428 Neilston - Glasgow Central] from Line 4 through Line C.  
17-APR-19 15:10 SSM WSC updates both TC's 3385 & adjoining TC3384 both failed holding a route strip from Line 4 across to Line D at Gantry A at 1503hrs. S&T subsequently confirmed as having been granted their line blockage at 1506hrs, which they are still in possession of.  
17-APR-19 15:18 ICC Flight Engineer updates S&T have given feedback on the IBJ between TC's 3384 & 3373, 1 of the bolts on the 4 hole IBJ has had a single new bolt installed. This has been knocked with a hammer and the RCMS traces on both tracks have returned to a healthy status. 
17-APR-19 15:41 ICC Flight Engineer updates traces for TC's 3373 & 3384 are again showing a significant deterioration akin to that of the original alarms.  
17-APR-19 Issue discussed between IC West and Track Supervisor [G.Inglis] regarding the subsequent deterioration of the associated traces. Supervisor requested to provide timescales and requirements to replace the suspect IBJ bolt should it again drop into failure mode, however advises no staff now available to attend and undertake any such tasks prior to night shift staff booking on later this evening.
17-APR-19  Requested that discussion is made between himself and the TSM Central [J.McGuire] regarding a potential resource strategy from a Central Track hierarchy perspective as a mitigation measure of a subsequent failure.

11-JUN-19 04:33: S&T update ICC 473 points are currently failing FPL testing. At present, they are trying to source more packing. P/Way are currently on site with S&T. Further updates to follow.
11-JUN-19 05:00
WSSC reports S&T advise no traffic to be routed over 473 points in any direction. 
This will prevent services being routed from the Up Corkerhill line onto the Up Ayr line and services running along the Down Ayr from Shields Junction towards Paisley Gilmour Street. 
11-JUN-19 05:05
Central S&T, P. Malone, contacted and situation discussed.
As detailed, 473 points are failing the FPL test on the normal side.
S&T are waiting on the arrival of packing to assist in bringing FPL into spec. Staff with packing should arrive within 10"". 
S&T have agreed that the outcome of this will be given to Control at 05:30. If unsuccessful, 473 points will secured in the normal position with detection.
11-JUN-19 05:22: WSSC reports possession given up and Line Blockage granted to S&T to continue working on points. 
11-JUN-19 05:35: S&T 2nd On Call, S. Gamble, on site. He will contact S&T 3rd On Call, L. Ross, to advise. 
11-JUN-19 06:20: S&T 2nd On Call, S. Gamble, requested for update and advise points will be secured within 5 minutes and Line Blockage given up.
S&T Supervisor not aware of any issues with 472 points. 
11-JUN-19 06:26: WSSC SSM advises blockage given up.
11-JUN-19 11:55: L Ross (SME) advises that following the points issues this morning, the S&T are looking for a 10 min blockage on the Down Ayr to allow the staff to have a look at the points. They suspect there may be an issue with the front tubular stretcher bar and want to confirm if this is the case before work commences after close of service.

However, cannot guarantee this will rectify the failure. S&T would require a further 30 minute line blockage to do this.

24-OCT-19 G Mackie advises the following:-  Part of my recommendations on completing the wrong side failure paperwork is that this area needs planned preventative  treatment in future autumn seasons (or possibly more if it has been included this year). I would also recommend further continued treatment through this autumn period.

24-OCT-19 G Mackie advises the following (part 2):- It is also a repeat site/track circuit for WSF due to rail head contamination.
The track circuit also does not have RCM on it so poses more of a risk as there is no heads up deterioration prior to failing wrong side to allow intervention. I have added it to our list of tracks for RCM installation.
